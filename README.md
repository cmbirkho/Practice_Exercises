#### The code and data in this repository is aimed at providing users with an opportunity to practice basic coding techniques in various languages to solve problems. It is best suited for an individual who is just beginning their journey in data science/learning a new programming language. I've solved these problems in one way, but there are multiple ways to do it. Let these examples serve as a jumping off point.

#### For this exercise we are using the data `/data/tables.xlsx` to answer the following questions:
1. Write code to provide a list of clients that purchased the brand 'king' and have an email address
2. Write code to provide three lists:
    - One list of distinct clients that purchased from only the online channel and not the store channel
    - One list of distinct clients that purchase from only the store channel and not online
    - One list of distinct clients that purchased from both the online and store channel
3. Write code to provide the count of distinct clients, total orders, total sales, and average purchase by purchase channel
4. Write code to provide a list of distinct clients that have an email address, signed up for email after 01/01/2010, and purchased tops after 3/10/2010
5. Write code to provide a list of each email address and each email addresses total sales.
